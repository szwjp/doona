</div>

doona is a static web UI for monitoring proxy traffic and managing nodes, groups, rules and configuration. It requires a running [honk](https://github.com/daeuniverse/honk) or [dae](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae) backend with the native API enabled.

Available features depend on the backend’s capabilities and configuration; see the [feature requirements](https://daeuniverse.org/doona/feature-requirements).

## Two editions

doona lite is a preview in testing in 0.1.0-rc.8; its pages and behaviour may change. Both editions connect to the same backend with the same administrator credentials.

| Area               | Standard edition                                          | doona lite (preview)                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Traffic monitoring | Activity, connections, flows, DNS, logs and events        | no monitoring pages                                |
| Configuration      | source editor, diagnostics, global settings and revisions | forms for nodes, subscriptions and global settings |

| Intended use       | full interface for everyday management                    | smaller configuration editor                       |

## Try the demo

Try the UI with sample data; no backend is needed.

[Standard edition](https://demo.daeuniverse.org/)

[doona lite (preview)](https://demo.daeuniverse.org/lite/)

To see error states, use [`?scenario=faults`](https://demo.daeuniverse.org/?scenario=faults); `?scenario=` returns to the healthy demo.

## Install

honk's full releases already embed doona, and dae can serve it too: point `api.ui` at the directory that holds the built app and the panel opens at `/ui/`, while API calls still need the token. Follow the [quick start](https://daeuniverse.org/doona/quick-start) to use it; the documentation also covers installing doona separately. Editing the configuration over the API needs `api.config_write` and its managed directory layout (`config.dae` including `config.d/*.dae` and `api.dae`). On Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE, install it from the daeuniverse package repository: `doona-web` on Debian and Ubuntu, `doona` on Fedora and openSUSE, with the repository set up as described for [Debian](https://daeuniverse.org/guide/packages/debian), [Fedora](https://daeuniverse.org/guide/packages/fedora) and [openSUSE](https://daeuniverse.org/guide/packages/opensuse). The release archives and packages stay available from the GitHub releases.

## Backend protocols

The engine handles proxying; see the [honk node reference](https://github.com/daeuniverse/honk/blob/main/doc/en/reference/nodes.md#protocols) or [dae's proxy protocols](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae/blob/main/docs/en/proxy-protocols.md) for supported protocols, transports and limits.

## Latest release

[0.1.0-rc.8](CHANGELOG.md) has 2 fixes.

This release fixes node management on a dae backend: dae writes every section to its own include (`config.d/node.dae`), and a node there is no longer treated as declared outside the main file and therefore unremovable. The reload command and the probe settings also stop naming honk on a dae backend.
